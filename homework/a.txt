In this book, Hawking guides readers through the strange realms of outer space, introducing distant galaxies, black holes, quarks, tasty particles, spinning particles, antimatter, time arrows, and other ancient questions such as what the universe is like, space and time, and relativity. It gives readers a preliminary understanding of the mysteries of cosmology such as special relativity and the origin of time and universe.

The main contents of a brief history of time can be summarized as follows:

The 1. starting point of time is the cosmic big bang singularity. The universe is expanding, and it should have shrunk to a point in the first place. This moment is called the Big Bang. The density of the universe at this point is infinite. This is mathematically called singularity.

2. the end of time - black hole. Stars will shrink because of gravitation and form a "black hole". The gravitational attraction of the black hole is very strong, and time will end here.

3. how does God start the universe? The origin and destiny of the universe. One is the origin of the universe, which is explained by the principle of anthropology, called the disordered boundary condition; the other is the "inflation model," which assumes that the universe expands at an acceleration in the first instant and that the radius of the universe increases by 100 billion times in less than a second.

4. the unification of physics -- the ultimate theory. Man seeks to establish a complete, coordinated, unified theory applicable to every event in the universe, in which no specific constants are required to conform to the facts.In this book, Hawking guides readers through the strange realms of outer space, introducing distant galaxies, black holes, quarks, tasty particles, spinning particles, antimatter, time arrows, and other ancient questions such as what the universe is like, space and time, and relativity.

The 1. starting point of time is the cosmic big bang singularity. The universe is expanding, and it should have shrunk to a point in the first place. This moment is called the Big Bang. The density of the universe at this point is infinite. This is mathematically called singularity.

2. the end of time - black hole. Stars will shrink because of gravitation and form a "black hole". The gravitational attraction of the black hole is very strong, and time will end here.

3. how does God start the universe? The origin and destiny of the universe. One is the origin of the universe, which is explained by the principle of anthropology, called the disordered boundary condition; the other is the "inflation model," which assumes that the universe expands at an acceleration in the first instant and that the radius of the universe increases by 100 billion times in less than a second.

4. the unification of physics -- the ultimate theory. Man seeks to establish a complete, coordinated, unified theory applicable to every event in the universe, in which no specific constants are required to conform to the facts.In this book, Hawking guides readers through the strange realms of outer space, introducing distant galaxies, black holes, quarks, tasty particles, spinning particles, antimatter, time arrows, and other ancient questions such as what the universe is like, space and time, and relativity.

3. how does God start the universe? The origin and destiny of the universe. One is the origin of the universe, which is explained by the principle of anthropology, called the disordered boundary condition; the other is the "inflation model," which assumes that the universe expands at an acceleration in the first instant and that the radius of the universe increases by 100 billion times in less than a second.

4. the unification of physics -- the ultimate theory. Man seeks to establish a complete, coordinated, unified theory applicable to every event in the universe, in which no specific constants are required to conform to the facts.In this book, Hawking guides readers through the strange realms of outer space, introducing distant galaxies, black holes, quarks, tasty particles, spinning particles, antimatter, time arrows, and other ancient questions such as what the universe is like, space and time, and relativity. It gives readers a preliminary understanding of the mysteries of cosmology such as special relativity and the origin of time and universe.

One is the origin of the universe, which is explained by the principle of anthropology, called the disordered boundary condition; the other is the "inflation model," which assumes that the universe expands at an acceleration in the first instant and that the radius of the universe increases by 100 billion times in less than a second.

4. the unification of physics -- the ultimate theory. Man seeks to establish a complete, coordinated, unified theory applicable to every event in the universe, in which no specific constants are required to conform to the facts.In this book, Hawking guides readers through the strange realms of outer space, introducing distant galaxies, black holes, quarks, tasty particles, spinning particles, antimatter, time arrows, and other ancient questions such as what the universe is like, space and time, and relativity. It gives readers a preliminary understanding of the mysteries of cosmology such as special relativity and the origin of time and universe.

The main contents of a brief history of time can be summarized as follows:

The 1. starting point of time is the cosmic big bang singularity. The universe is expanding, and it should have shrunk to a point in the first place. This moment is called the Big Bang. The density of the universe at this point is infinite. This is mathematically called singularity.

2. the end of time - black hole. Stars will shrink because of gravitation and form a "black hole". The gravitational attraction of the black hole is very strong, and time will end here.

Man seeks to establish a complete, coordinated, unified theory applicable to every event in the universe, in which no specific constants are required to conform to the facts.In this book, Hawking guides readers through the strange realms of outer space, introducing distant galaxies, black holes, quarks, tasty particles, spinning particles, antimatter, time arrows, and other ancient questions such as what the universe is like, space and time, and relativity. It gives readers a preliminary understanding of the mysteries of cosmology such as special relativity and the origin of time and universe.

The main contents of a brief history of time can be summarized as follows:

The 1. starting point of time is the cosmic big bang singularity. The universe is expanding, and it should have shrunk to a point in the first place. This moment is called the Big Bang. The density of the universe at this point is infinite. This is mathematically called singularity.

2. the end of time - black hole. Stars will shrink because of gravitation and form a "black hole". The gravitational attraction of the black hole is very strong, and time will end here.

3. how does God start the universe? The origin and destiny of the universe.

Man seeks to establish a complete, coordinated, unified theory applicable to every event in the universe, in which no specific constants are required to conform to the facts.In this book, Hawking guides readers through the strange realms of outer space, introducing distant galaxies, black holes, quarks, tasty particles, spinning particles, antimatter, time arrows, and other ancient questions such as what the universe is like, space and time, and relativity. It gives readers a preliminary understanding of the mysteries of cosmology such as special relativity and the origin of time and universe.

The main contents of a brief history of time can be summarized as follows:

The 1. starting point of time is the cosmic big bang singularity. The universe is expanding, and it should have shrunk to a point in the first place. This moment is called the Big Bang. The density of the universe at this point is infinite. This is mathematically called singularity.

2. the end of time - black hole. Stars will shrink because of gravitation and form a "black hole". The gravitational attraction of the black hole is very strong, and time will end here.

3. how does God start the universe? The origin and destiny of the universe.

Man seeks to establish a complete, coordinated, unified theory applicable to every event in the universe, in which no specific constants are required to conform to the facts.In this book, Hawking guides readers through the strange realms of outer space, introducing distant galaxies, black holes, quarks, tasty particles, spinning particles, antimatter, time arrows, and other ancient questions such as what the universe is like, space and time, and relativity. It gives readers a preliminary understanding of the mysteries of cosmology such as special relativity and the origin of time and universe.

The main contents of a brief history of time can be summarized as follows:

The 1. starting point of time is the cosmic big bang singularity. The universe is expanding, and it should have shrunk to a point in the first place. This moment is called the Big Bang. The density of the universe at this point is infinite. This is mathematically called singularity.

2. the end of time - black hole. Stars will shrink because of gravitation and form a "black hole". The gravitational attraction of the black hole is very strong, and time will end here.

3. how does God start the universe? The origin and destiny of the universe.

Man seeks to establish a complete, coordinated, unified theory applicable to every event in the universe, in which no specific constants are required to conform to the facts.In this book, Hawking guides readers through the strange realms of outer space, introducing distant galaxies, black holes, quarks, tasty particles, spinning particles, antimatter, time arrows, and other ancient questions such as what the universe is like, space and time, and relativity. It gives readers a preliminary understanding of the mysteries of cosmology such as special relativity and the origin of time and universe.

The main contents of a brief history of time can be summarized as follows:

The 1. starting point of time is the cosmic big bang singularity. The universe is expanding, and it should have shrunk to a point in the first place. This moment is called the Big Bang. The density of the universe at this point is infinite. This is mathematically called singularity.

2. the end of time - black hole. Stars will shrink because of gravitation and form a "black hole". The gravitational attraction of the black hole is very strong, and time will end here.

3. how does God start the universe? The origin and destiny of the universe.

Man seeks to establish a complete, coordinated, unified theory applicable to every event in the universe, in which no specific constants are required to conform to the facts.In this book, Hawking guides readers through the strange realms of outer space, introducing distant galaxies, black holes, quarks, tasty particles, spinning particles, antimatter, time arrows, and other ancient questions such as what the universe is like, space and time, and relativity. It gives readers a preliminary understanding of the mysteries of cosmology such as special relativity and the origin of time and universe.

The main contents of a brief history of time can be summarized as follows:

The 1. starting point of time is the cosmic big bang singularity. The universe is expanding, and it should have shrunk to a point in the first place. This moment is called the Big Bang. The density of the universe at this point is infinite. This is mathematically called singularity.

2. the end of time - black hole. Stars will shrink because of gravitation and form a "black hole". The gravitational attraction of the black hole is very strong, and time will end here.

3. how does God start the universe? The origin and destiny of the universe.

Man seeks to establish a complete, coordinated, unified theory applicable to every event in the universe, in which no specific constants are required to conform to the facts.In this book, Hawking guides readers through the strange realms of outer space, introducing distant galaxies, black holes, quarks, tasty particles, spinning particles, antimatter, time arrows, and other ancient questions such as what the universe is like, space and time, and relativity. It gives readers a preliminary understanding of the mysteries of cosmology such as special relativity and the origin of time and universe.

The main contents of a brief history of time can be summarized as follows:

The 1. starting point of time is the cosmic big bang singularity. The universe is expanding, and it should have shrunk to a point in the first place. This moment is called the Big Bang. The density of the universe at this point is infinite. This is mathematically called singularity.

2. the end of time - black hole. Stars will shrink because of gravitation and form a "black hole". The gravitational attraction of the black hole is very strong, and time will end here.

3. how does God start the universe? The origin and destiny of the universe.

Man seeks to establish a complete, coordinated, unified theory applicable to every event in the universe, in which no specific constants are required to conform to the facts.In this book, Hawking guides readers through the strange realms of outer space, introducing distant galaxies, black holes, quarks, tasty particles, spinning particles, antimatter, time arrows, and other ancient questions such as what the universe is like, space and time, and relativity. It gives readers a preliminary understanding of the mysteries of cosmology such as special relativity and the origin of time and universe.

The main contents of a brief history of time can be summarized as follows:

The 1. starting point of time is the cosmic big bang singularity. The universe is expanding, and it should have shrunk to a point in the first place. This moment is called the Big Bang. The density of the universe at this point is infinite. This is mathematically called singularity.

2. the end of time - black hole. Stars will shrink because of gravitation and form a "black hole". The gravitational attraction of the black hole is very strong, and time will end here.

3. how does God start the universe? The origin and destiny of the universe.

Man seeks to establish a complete, coordinated, unified theory applicable to every event in the universe, in which no specific constants are required to conform to the facts.In this book, Hawking guides readers through the strange realms of outer space, introducing distant galaxies, black holes, quarks, tasty particles, spinning particles, antimatter, time arrows, and other ancient questions such as what the universe is like, space and time, and relativity. It gives readers a preliminary understanding of the mysteries of cosmology such as special relativity and the origin of time and universe.

The main contents of a brief history of time can be summarized as follows:

The 1. starting point of time is the cosmic big bang singularity. The universe is expanding, and it should have shrunk to a point in the first place. This moment is called the Big Bang. The density of the universe at this point is infinite. This is mathematically called singularity.

2. the end of time - black hole. Stars will shrink because of gravitation and form a "black hole". The gravitational attraction of the black hole is very strong, and time will end here.

3. how does God start the universe? The origin and destiny of the universe.

Man seeks to establish a complete, coordinated, unified theory applicable to every event in the universe, in which no specific constants are required to conform to the facts.In this book, Hawking guides readers through the strange realms of outer space, introducing distant galaxies, black holes, quarks, tasty particles, spinning particles, antimatter, time arrows, and other ancient questions such as what the universe is like, space and time, and relativity. It gives readers a preliminary understanding of the mysteries of cosmology such as special relativity and the origin of time and universe.

The main contents of a brief history of time can be summarized as follows:

The 1. starting point of time is the cosmic big bang singularity. The universe is expanding, and it should have shrunk to a point in the first place. This moment is called the Big Bang. The density of the universe at this point is infinite. This is mathematically called singularity.

2. the end of time - black hole. Stars will shrink because of gravitation and form a "black hole". The gravitational attraction of the black hole is very strong, and time will end here.

3. how does God start the universe? The origin and destiny of the universe.
